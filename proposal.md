# Juniors Spring Intensive Deliverable Proposal

## TODO: copy this file, fill it out, and push it up to your project's repo.

Dates 3/16-3/25

**My Name:** 
Ahmed Shahrour


**Project Name:** 
Jumpin

**Is your project New or Old?**
New

**Is your project Solo or Team?**
Solo

## Description

**Write a paragraph summary of the current status of your project, what you hope to achieve during the intensive, how and why**
It's a platform for users to find games around them 'to jump into'. Games can be created and booked via the platform. The objective is to test for appetite by providing a working MVP for my early adopters to use. I'll do so by using an MVC architecture for the backend. I'm hoping to use what I've been taught in BEW 1.3 (NodeJS and Handlebars) and apply it for a quick MVP.


## Challenges I Anticipate

**List out the challenges you anticipate for completing this project**
- I've always used JWT to authenticate users but I haven't used the faster method of good old cookies. Didnt get my hands dirty on authentication for a while so I might loose track of time
- Ensuring Date and Location formats are consistent, I feel like I'll hit on many bugs there.
- I might not have time to finish the landing page without finishing the main MVP functionality.

## Skateboard

**ONE SINGLE aspect of product. Consider: build backend for SPD 1.2 front end, CRUD one resource, use API or library, authentication etc.**

Build backend using NodeJS and build the frontend using Handlebars & Bootstrap, CRUD Games (The viewing can be done for everyone)

**Start coding and finish “Skateboard” feature before beginning “Bike”.** 

## Bike
**ONE additional features that get you closer to your idealized product. Examples: CRUD 2nd resource, add comments, API use, authentication, library use** 

CRUD Users and realtionships to Games

## Car
**ONE additional feature**
Authentication and Authorization 


## Personal Achievement Goals:

**Each teammate must achieve 2 of 3 of their self-set personal achievement goals. If you're not on a team, delete the other teammate sections as needed.**

1. To scope the limit of work based on time limitations
2. To be able to stay well within time to sprinkle it up
3. Be productive using the kaban card decks
